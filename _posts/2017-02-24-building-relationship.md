One day while I was working at one of my projects in the city, an older lady walked by and struck up a conversation with me about what we were working on. She was the next door neighbor and told me that she had been watching us work for a while and was really impressed with the quality of our work and our work ethic. She asked me if I could take a look at a table she had that she wanted refinished and if I could refinish it for her. 

At first I was a little hesitant because I had never refinished furniture and being a remodeler, refinishing furniture is not something I was too interested in doing. However, after talking with her for a while and building a relationship with her, I decided to refinish the table for her just because I wanted to take care of her. Little did I know, that table would lead to a small bathroom renovation she wanted to do, and other various bigger projects around the house she has had an interest in doing.

That small table refinishing project opened the door to bigger projects and also, more importantly, access to her network of friends that she will refer me to. I'm learning very quickly that sometimes as professionals, we seek only those things that we are the most comfortable with or that make us a lot of money. 

By being caring, honest, and providing value to this lady even with such a small project, I am able to grow professionally and expand my clientele.
